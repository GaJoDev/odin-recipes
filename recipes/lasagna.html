				The Most Amazing Lasagna Recipe is the best recipe for homemade
				Italian-style lasagna. The balance between layers of cheese, noodles,
				and homemade bolognese sauce is perfection!
			</p>

			<p>
				Homemade lasagna is the best. It tastes nothing like the ones from the
				frozen food aisle. This recipe is so good—it makes the kind of lasagna
				people write home about! It brings together all of the things we love in
				a good pasta dish: noodles, cheeses, fresh herbs and a delicious meat
				sauce. If you’ve never made lasagna before or haven’t found a good
				recipe, you have come to the right place. Invite a friend because you
				won’t want to keep this dish to yourself!
